    Refactor documentation and results for scalar diffusion problems
    
    - Updated convergence results for 2D and 3D diffusion problems with various boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Robin).
    - Added new markdown files for 1D and 2D diffusion problems, including analytical solutions and CSV data integration.
    - Removed outdated 3D diffusion Poisson Dirichlet convergence documentation.
    - Improved data presentation in markdown format using Julia's CSV and DataFrames packages.
    - Added a new article on a space-time Cartesian cut-cell method for two-phase diffusion problems.

    Add benchmark results for scalar 2D and 3D diffusion problems
    
    - Introduced new markdown files for temporal convergence benchmarks using Backward Euler and Crank–Nicolson methods for the scalar 2D heat equation with Robin interface conditions.
    - Added convergence results for scalar 2D diffusion heat problems with Robin boundary conditions, including L^2 and L^Inf norms.
    - Implemented shifted mean error analysis for scalar 2D diffusion heat problems with Robin conditions.
    - Included convergence studies for scalar 2D and 3D Poisson problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
    - Added Schwartz–Colella benchmarks for expanding, fixed, and shrinking disks in 2D heat equations.
    - Created a script to run all benchmark problem scripts and report results, enhancing automation for testing and validation.

    Add convergence data and utility functions for phase flow analysis
    
    - Introduced new CSV files for convergence results of various methods including Scalar 3D Diffusion, Schwartz-Colella, and diphasic heat transfer cases.
    - Implemented the `BenchPhaseFlow` module with essential functions for counting inside cells and computing convergence orders.
    - Created utility functions in `utils/convergence.jl` for generating convergence dataframes for both monophasic and diphasic cases.
    - Added tests in `test/runtests.jl` to ensure the correctness of the implemented functions.
